description: Review and analyze PR code review comments (optionally specify PR number)
---

Use the Task tool to launch the pr-review-analyzer subagent to analyze code review comments.

If the user provided a PR number after the command (e.g., `/review-pr 123`), analyze that specific PR.
Otherwise, analyze the PR for the current branch.
