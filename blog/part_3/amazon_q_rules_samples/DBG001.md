# DBG001: Diagnose Before Fixing
## Purpose
This rule ensures that the root cause of errors is always investigated before attempting fixes to avoid creating additional problems.

## Instructions
- When errors occur, run tests/commands to see the actual error messages
- Read error messages carefully to understand the root cause
- Don't assume the fix based on symptoms - verify what's actually failing
- For import errors, check if it's missing modules, wrong paths, or circular imports
- For test failures, examine the actual vs expected behavior
- Make targeted fixes based on the diagnosed root cause, not assumptions
- **ALWAYS run tests after writing or modifying them to verify they work**
- Never assume tests will pass - validate by running them
- **ONLY run the specific test being worked on** - don't run all tests unless changes affect existing functionality
- Running unnecessary tests wastes time and resources

## Priority
CRITICAL

## Valid usage
```python
# Error occurs: "ImportError: cannot import name 'DataclassFactory'"
# Step 1: Run the failing import to see exact error
# Step 2: Check what's available: from polyfactory import *
# Step 3: Discover ModelFactory is correct for Pydantic models
# Step 4: Fix with correct import: from polyfactory.factories.pydantic_factory import ModelFactory
# Step 5: Run test to verify it works
```

## Invalid usage
```python
# Error occurs: "ImportError: cannot import name 'DataclassFactory'"
# Bad: Immediately assume it's a missing dependency and try to install packages
# Bad: Change import paths without understanding what's actually wrong
# Bad: Make multiple changes at once without testing each one
# Bad: Write/modify tests and assume they work without running them
```

## Examples
- Import error → Run the failing import to see the exact error message
- Test failure → Read the assertion failure details and stack trace  
- Linting error → Check what specific rule is being violated
- Path operation error → Check if Mock vs real Path is the issue
- **Test modification → Run the test to verify it works**
